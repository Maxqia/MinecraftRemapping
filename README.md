# Sponge Remapping [![Build Status](http://jenkins.maxqia.com/buildStatus/icon?job=SpongePlugins)](http://jenkins.maxqia.com/job/SpongePlugins/)
Tools for remapping Bukkit Plugins to the Sponge API with Pore(RT) and plugins that I've remapped myself.

You can get these plugins [here](https://jenkins.maxqia.com/job/SpongePlugins/lastSuccessfulBuild/).
If you would like a plugin to be ported, please open an issue on the [PoreRT](https://github.com/Maxqia/PoreRT) project.
